## PostgreSQL Practice Overview

This project demonstrates my hands-on practice with PostgreSQL using **PgAdmin** as a GUI tool. I focused on essential SQL operations and relational database concepts.

##  Key Concepts Practiced

- Installed and used **PgAdmin** to manage PostgreSQL databases.
- Created and modified tables (CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
- Performed **CRUD** operations (Insert, Select, Update, Delete).
- Practiced different types of **JOINS**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN.
- Used GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY for advanced querying.
- Applied **subqueries** using IN and EXISTS.
- Filtered data with WHERE, AND, IN, and LIKE.

This practice helped strengthen my understanding of database design and SQL querying, preparing me for real-world database projects.
